/*Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.*/

//set an array stores the occurrence times of each letter with the index as 26 letters;
//tranverse the String s, add the occurrence times of each letter to the array
//tranverse the String t, minus the occurrence times of each letter to the array
//all the letters' conrespondingly value in the array are 0 except the one only occurence once.
//transe the array, find the index which value is not 0
